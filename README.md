# Decentralized Clinical Trial Data Management

A blockchain-based platform for secure, transparent, and compliant management of clinical trial data across the entire research lifecycle.

## Overview

This decentralized system revolutionizes clinical trial management by leveraging blockchain technology to enhance data integrity, participant privacy, and regulatory compliance. The platform creates an immutable audit trail of all trial activities while enabling secure sharing of information between authorized stakeholders.

## Core Components

### Patient Enrollment Contract
- Manages digital consent processes with cryptographic verification
- Validates participant eligibility against pre-defined criteria
- Creates privacy-preserving digital identities for trial participants
- Maintains comprehensive enrollment records with timestamp verification

### Data Collection Contract
- Securely captures and stores clinical observations and trial results
- Implements end-to-end encryption for sensitive patient information
- Enables integration with IoT medical devices and electronic health records
- Provides tamper-proof storage with selective disclosure capabilities

### Protocol Compliance Contract
- Ensures adherence to predefined study procedures and timelines
- Automates protocol validation through smart contract logic
- Tracks investigator actions against approved study protocols
- Generates real-time compliance reports for sponsors and regulators

### Adverse Event Reporting Contract
